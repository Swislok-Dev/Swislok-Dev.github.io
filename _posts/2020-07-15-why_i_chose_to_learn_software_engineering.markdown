I have always had an interest in learning how things worked. I had decided when I was nine years old that I wanted to be an astronomer and learn more about the universe. From what I had learned about "space" was that it was big! I wanted to know why we have never met anyone from other planets or how our solar system had formed. It was intriguing to learn how smaller elements of "dust" would form and begin to create stars and planets would form from gravitational forces coming together. This want-to-know-more had me looking at every facet of life to figure out how stuff worked. I got into playing video games and thought of how this was made and what it takes to create a virtual image on the screen that did stuff when you moved through virtual space. 

I later discovered Discord and the use of bots was quite expansive and I wanted to create a bot of my own to help run a server that I moderate. So I began looking up YouTube tutorials and found that using the Python language was able to create one for myself. Upon getting a bot up and running began to add in my own commands and automation for this little bot to handle the heavy lifting and was able to keep things fairly simple as far as moderating a voice server goes and keeping things PG.

This brings me to now after a year of finding tutorials and small learning sites that I decided to make an educational choice and learn how to do it right, the way that many others have learned and put to the test and are actually in a better job now. I wish to learn how to make applications and know how to make them do what I want them to as that feels the closest that I will ever get to doing real magic! I have high hopes from my previous times at coding and making small projects that I'll be able to learn how to work on bigger projects and find myself in a better position and create a better living for myself.
